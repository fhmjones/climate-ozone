## Ozone at two locations for all of 2017

### Purpose

Plot two data sets with any combination of raw data, 7-day avg, or maximum daily 8-hr avg.

### Instructions

* Select timeseries to display using checkboxes. Dropdown sets trace type for Abb's data only ("markers" type plots slowly).
* Zoom, pan, examine datapoint values, etc. using graph controls, upper right when your mouse is over the graph.
* Zoom the time-window only using 'click-and-hold' then drag horizontally and release.
* Move the graphed window by clicking the "Pan" button. Reset using the the little **"home"** icon.

YVR = Vancouver airport, Abb = Abbotsford and MDA8 = maximum daily 8 hour average.
